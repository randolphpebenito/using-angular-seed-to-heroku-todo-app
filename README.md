# `A Simple AngularJS Todo Application using angular-seed` 

This project is a simple web application using angular-seed to bootstrap this project. It has the necessary CRUD functionality for any Todo App out there.
This app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire the front end (AngularJS) and back end (Django Rest Framework).


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone this repository and install the dependencies:

### Clone `using-angular-seed-to-heroku-todo-app`

Clone the `using-angular-seed-to-heroku-todo-app` repository using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/randolphpebenito/using-angular-seed-to-heroku-todo-app.git
cd using-angular-seed-to-heroku-todo-app
```


### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [Node package manager][npm].
* We get the Angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].
* In order to run the end-to-end tests, you will also need to have the
  [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] installed on your machine. Check out the section on
  [end-to-end testing](#e2e-testing) for more info.

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`. After that, you should find out that you have
two new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the Angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
`angular-seed` changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file. Putting it in the `app` folder
makes it easier to serve the files by a web server.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at [`localhost:8000/index.html`][local-app-url].


## Deploy to Heroku

```
heroku login
heroku create <your-desired-project-name>
git push heroku master
heroku open
```


### Running the App during Development

This project comes preconfigured with a local development web server. It is a Node.js
tool called [http-server][http-server]. You can start this web server with `npm start`, but you may
choose to install the tool globally:

```
sudo npm install -g http-server
```

Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by running:

```
http-server -a localhost -p 8000
```

Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own web server, such as Apache or Nginx. Just
configure your server to serve the files under the `app/` directory.

### Running the App in Production

This really depends on how complex your app is and the overall infrastructure of your system, but
the general rule is that all you need in production are the files under the `app/` directory.
Everything else should be omitted.

Angular apps are really just a bunch of static HTML, CSS and JavaScript files that need to be hosted
somewhere they can be accessed by browsers.

If your Angular app is talking to the backend server via XHR or other means, you need to figure out
what is the best way to host the static files to comply with the same origin policy if applicable.
Usually this is done by hosting the files by the backend server or through reverse-proxying the
backend server(s) and web server(s).
